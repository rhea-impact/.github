# Rhea Impact

A Dallas–Fort Worth nonprofit exploring what happens when robots help the people who need them most.

We focus on real-world impact for:
- Seniors living alone
- Single parents and caregivers
- People with mobility or health limitations

## Free Software for Coding Agents

Alongside our humanoid-robot projects, we release **free, open-source software** designed to work with coding agents and AI copilots.

Our goals:
- Turn everyday life tasks into repeatable agent workflows
- Make productivity tools accessible to people who aren't programmers
- Open up patterns and reference implementations anyone can adopt or improve
